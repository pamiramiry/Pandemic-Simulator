# Pandemic-Simulator
Simulated a community of people interacting with each other and created a temporal network with the interactions. Next we randomly inffect certain amount of people to see how a virus would spread.

Temopral Network

Nodes: People

Edges: Interactions with two people

Edges weight: The time when the Interactions occur

With the Temporal Network we do various graph analysis to find the best containment strategies with the help of the library Network X.

The different Containment Strategies we used was random edge removal, random node removal, Temporal approximation Page Rank, Edge Betweeness.
